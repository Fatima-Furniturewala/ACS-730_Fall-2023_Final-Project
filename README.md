###Deployment pre-requisites:

Create two S3 buckets 'acs730-group5' and 'mchung46-test-web'.The first buckets will store Terraform state, it holds two root folders: dev and prod, in which there are network and webservers respectively. The second one is for the website.

##Deployment Process - Terraform part

1.  Start with the github code.
2.  Update the config.tf in dev and prod subfolders to reflect the bucket names.
3.  Update the desired input varibles in dev/network and deploy dev/network with the commands below
4.  Create Networks

 ```
    cd ~/environment/project/dev/network 
    tf init
    tf plan
    tf apply --auto-approve    
 ```

5. Create Webservers

```
   cd ~/environment/project/dev/webservers 
   tf init
   tf plan
   tf apply --auto-approve
```

6. Ansible Dynamic Inventory
   need to make sure the python version is not conlfict in ur environment
   
```
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts.txt playbook1.yaml
sudo nano /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
ansible-playbook -i aws_ec2.yamlÂ playbook1.yaml
```

7. Static Website
   
8. Clean Up process

The clean up process is a reverse of the deployment process,

1. Delete webservers instances 

```
   cd ~/environment/project/dev/webservers 
   tf destroy --auto-approve
```

2. Delete  network and its subnets 

```
   cd ~/environment/project/dev/network 
   tf destroy --auto-approve
```
